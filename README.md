ScreenSwitcher
==========

A tiny application that will rotate your monitor 90° (and back).
Build for a dualmonitor setup where the monitors have a pivot function (mainly for programming), more then 2 monitors not supported.

This application will rotate the screen where your application has focus on, and is activated by the shortkey SHIFT+ESCAPE or rightclicking the context menu in the tray bar.

Advised is to put a *shortcut* to the .exe in your Startup folder.
